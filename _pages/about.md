I currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate at <a href="https://www.umassmed.edu/garberlab/">Garber Lab</a>, working with
<a href="https://profiles.umassmed.edu/display/11976488">Alper Kucukural</a> for implementing data integration algorithms for

I am interested in network learning, biomedical data integration and biomedical software platforms.
