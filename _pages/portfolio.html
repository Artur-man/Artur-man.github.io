    <p>First Statistics, then Computational Science and now Computational Biology ... I am a Statistician with extensive 
    experiance in scientific computing. I rather call myself a "Computational Statistician" which I believe better represents
    my skills and education. I have a Master's degree from <a href="http://www.be.itu.edu.tr/en">Informatics Institute, ITU </a>, 
    the place to get an Informatics education in Turkey. Since then, I had two excellent mentors that shaped my academic career as a
    scientist, 
    <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mfZRKvoAAAAJ&hl=en">Elvan Ceyhan</a> and
    <a href="https://web.itu.edu.tr/~tekinad/">Adem Tekin</a>. Especially with Dr. Ceyhan, I have been introduced to the magnificent 
      world of Graph Theory and its applications to Computational Statistics. </p>
    <p>I am fascinated by Networks and graphs, I enjoy their complexity and interpretability, and now I have decided to go 
    on a path to discovering what computational biology has to offer! Therefore, I see Biological Networks as another milestone in
    my journey!</p>

    <p> Here is a photo of me, my wife Aslin and my handsome son Aris, at our new home in Boston. 
        We call ourselves "Triple A" for Artur, Aslin and Aris. My wife Aslin was the best thing that ever happened to me. 
        When I tell people about her, I always use the word "magical", as she sees through everyone and everything without 
        judgement or prejudice. She looks like she has everything although she may have little. She does not need
        possesions or anything, but her heart is already full with happiness and joy! I am fortunate to have a person like Aslin 
        in my life, and I thank god everyday that he gave us a well handsome, clever and kind boy like Aris. </p>
