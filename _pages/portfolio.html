    <p>First Statistics, then Computational Science and now Computational Biology ... I am a statistician and well educated in
    scientific computing. I rather call myself a <em>computational Statistician</em> which I believe better represents
    my skills and education. I have a Master's degree from <a href="http://www.be.itu.edu.tr/en">Informatics Institute, ITU </a>, 
    perhaps the place to get an Informatics education in Turkey. Since then, I had two excellent mentors that shaped my academic career as a
    scientist, 
    <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mfZRKvoAAAAJ&hl=en">Elvan Ceyhan</a> and
    <a href="https://web.itu.edu.tr/~tekinad/">Adem Tekin</a>. I am fortunate to have been introduced to the magnificent 
      world of Graph Theory and its applications to Computational Statistics by Prof.Ceyhan. </p>
    <p>I am fascinated by Networks and graphs, I enjoy their complexity and interpretability, but now I have decided to go 
    on a path to discovering what computational biology has to offer! I see Biological Networks as another milestone in
    my journey!</p>

    <p> Here is a photo of me, my wife Aslin and my handsome son Aris, at our new home in Boston. 
        We call ourselves "Triple A" for Artur, Aslin and Aris. I must say that my wife Aslin was the best thing that ever happened to me. 
        When I tell people about her, I always use the word "magical", she sees through everyone and everything as if she always
        tries to look for something that does not meet the eye. She seems like she has everything although she may have little. 
        She does not need possesions or anything, but her heart is already full with happiness and joy! I am fortunate to have a person like Aslin 
        in my life, and I thank to god everyday that he gave us a handsome, clever and kind boy like Aris. </p>
