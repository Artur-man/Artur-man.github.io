# Wastewater Metagenomics

<p style="text-align: justify"> 
Emanuel Wyler, Markus Landthaler and I are developing computational pipelines for analyzing and monitoring wastewater data across Berlin and other environmental sites. 
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
Emanuel Wyler and I are trying to understand the complexity of these comprehensive pools of organisms and RNA where we are aiming to discover new substances (such as novel Cas proteins) within the wastewater to be used in developing novel biological technologies.

# Multiomic Brain Atlas

<p style="text-align: justify"> This single cell brain atlas provides access to processed and analyzed data of human and mouse single cell (scRNA-Seq and scATAC-Seq) from large single cell multiomics studies conducted in Allen Institute for Brain Science as well as samples from additional projects such as FANTOM5 for CAGE-Seq. This integrative project has been conducted in collaboration with [https://www.umassmed.edu/gtc/about/faculty-publications/miguel-sena-esteves/](Sena-Esteves Lab) and [](Bioinformatics Core) at UMass Chan Medical School. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify"> In collaboration with Sena-Esteves Lab and Bioinformatics Core at UMass Chan Medical School, this website hosts a browser for interactively visualizing transcriptional profiles of mouse brain cell types, and two publicly accessible custom track hubs (for human and mouse) within UCSC genome browsers. </p>

# Vitiligo Atlas

<p style="text-align: justify">
In collaboration with Sena-Esteves Lab and Bioinformatics Core at UMass Chan Medical School, we provided access to the data we used in our recent publication ([Gellatly et. al 2021](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.abd8995)) where we sought to identify cellular communications that show disruption in lesions or in non-lesional skins of individuals suffering from Vitiligo, an autoimmune skin disease characterized by the targeted destruction of melanocytes by T cells.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
The data provided was obtained using our in-house [inDrop system](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.cell.2015.04.044) to generate single cell RNA-Seq profiles on affected and unaffected skin from vitiligo patients, as well as healthy controls. The data was analyzed using an end-to-end scRNA data analysis package called [SignallingSingleCell](https://github.com/garber-lab/SignallingSingleCell). 
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
All raw sequencing data was processed by the scRNA-Seq inDrop pipeline developed within the interactive pipeline manager DolphinNext ([Yukselen et. al 2020](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-020-6714-x)).

<!-- # Stevens-Johnsons Syndrome (SJS) -->

<!-- In high throughput sequencing era, genetic information is complex, chaotic and often incomprehensible. To this end, Bioinformatics has evolved to analyze and summarize massive sequencing data sets, and data scientific methods have been developed to investigate biological systems and cellular dynamics by using these large volumes of processed omics data.  -->

<!-- Across many projects, I have designed software platforms to generate information from such large sets of data in order to find similarities across countless datasets and to build network models to interrogate databases against each other to help biological scientists to build hypothesis. -->

<!-- Currently, we are developing additinal software tools to analyze spatial transcriptomics datasets and to infer spatial information of cellular systems.  -->
